🎬 Movie Recommendation System – Your Movie Binge Buddy 🍿

Tired of scrolling endlessly, trying to decide what to watch next? 😩 This little project has your back! Just pick a movie you like, and it instantly recommends 5 similar ones — complete with posters, titles, and a clean interface that feels smooth and modern. 🎞️✨

The magic happens behind the scenes: the data and recommendation logic were handled in "Jupyter Notebook", and the web app was brought to life using "Streamlit" in "PyCharm". With a smart combo of "content-based filtering" and "cosine similarity", the system understands your taste and fetches real-time posters using the "TMDb API". 🎬🖼️

💡 How It All Works

1. Movie data is cleaned and combined using "Jupyter Notebook"  
2. Features like genres, keywords, cast, and crew are merged into one "soup"  
3. That soup gets turned into numbers using "CountVectorizer"  
4. We compare movies using "cosine similarity" — smarter than just guessing!  
5. Preprocessed results are saved with "Pickle" to speed things up  
6. The interactive frontend is built using "Streamlit" in "PyCharm"  
7. Posters are pulled live using the "TMDb API"

🧰 Tools & Tech Behind the Scenes

1. Python (the brain of the project) 🧠  
2. Pandas & Scikit-learn for data wrangling and ML  
3. Jupyter Notebook for backend work  
4. Pickle for saving processed data  
5. Streamlit for a smooth user interface  
6. PyCharm for app development  
7. TMDb API to make it all look good with real movie posters

🚀 What Makes It Cool

1. Pick any movie and get 5 solid recommendations  
2. Real-time poster previews (not just boring titles!)  
3. Suggestions based on actual content — not random picks  
4. Clean, modern interface that runs right in your browser  
5. Lightweight, fast, and super beginner-friendly  
6. Great as a portfolio project or learning tool

👨‍🎓 Who’s This For?

1. Students or beginners exploring ML and Python  
2. Movie buffs looking for fresh recommendations  
3. Developers wanting a quick, cool project to show off  
4. Anyone curious about how recommendation engines work!

▶️ How to Get It Running

1. Clone this repo  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
````

2. Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Add your TMDb API key

   * Open the script and pop your key into the "fetch\_poster()" function
   * Don’t have one? Grab it free from: [https://www.themoviedb.org/](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

4. Fire it up!

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

5. Boom — your app is live in the browser. Choose a movie and get watching! 🍿
